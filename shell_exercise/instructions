SHELL CHALLENGE

Goal: create a shell script in /home/shell_exercise/alexia that satisfies all of the instructions listed below

Note: Before you start, backup the four example files in another directory to have a copy of them just in case they get modified



Instructions (the shell script must):

- Import the variables within base.sh into your new script without copying and pasting them
- Write a function that determines the number of files in the alexia/ directory and print it to the screen. If there are more files than expected,
  exit the script with a message. Hint: take a look at the variables you just imported to know exepected value(s)
- For all the example files in the alexia/ directory, you must rename the file to the value on the line (within that same file) given in the variables imported.
- Generate a new example5.info file that contains the contents of all the original files
- In example5.info, remove all the line breaks so that all the content is present one line.


Once you execute the script, it should perform all of the above in one go. Expected result is a new example5.info file with no line breaks and renamed original files.
